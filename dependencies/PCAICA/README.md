and Mark Schnitzer, NEURON (2009).


UPDATE 1.3 - APRIL 2013 ------------------------------- Fixed a problem with the function 
tiff_frames that altered its behavior in MATLAB 2012.

Fixed an inconsistency in CellsortPCA between create_tcov and
creat_xcov. In the current version, both methods agree with the previous
version of create_tcov.
